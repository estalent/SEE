Welcome to SEE (Simple ECMAScript Engine).

SEE is a library that provides an ECMAScript (JavaScript) run-time
environment.

Running configure and compiling in the normal way should provide
the library 'libsee.a' and a test application, 'see-shell'.  I
strongly recommend that you have Boehm-gc installed (it's a garbage
collector library) otherwise see-shell just uses the non-free'ing
malloc().  Run configure with the '--help' argument to see switches
on how to configure it for boehm-gc.

Documentation for development using the SEE library can be found in
USAGE.html.  The 'see-shell' program doubles as an example and
demonstration of how the library is intended to be used.

I hope someone finds this useful. Please send bug reports back to me
via <leonard@users.sourceforge.net>. New releases of SEE will be announced
at <http://freshmeat.net/projects/see/>
