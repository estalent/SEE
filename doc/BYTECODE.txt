SEE's intermediate bytecode representation
------------------------------------------

This document describes and defines SEE's intermediate code generation
virtual machine model and instructions.

SEE is designed to support different code generators. The model defined
in this document is an interface between the parser and the code generation-
execution back-end which implements the virtual machine.

The virtual machine executes a sequence of virtual instructions that 
ultimatgely operate on 

    * the environment available through a SEE_context structure
    * a virtual stack of SEE_values of known maximum size
    * a virtual stack of 'blocks' of known maximum size
    * a 'C' register (a SEE_value always of type SEE_COMPLETION)
    * an 'L' register (a SEE_location)
    * an 'E' register (used by S.ENUM/B.ENUM)
    * a program counter 'PC' (index into the instruction stream)

A sequence of instructions implements a SourceElements production
minus any FunctionDeclarations. That is, the code generator is used to
build bytecode that implements exactly one function. Thus, there is only
one entry point.

This document does not define a physical byte code format, instead
it defines the instructions identified by the enumerated types of code.h.
Some instructions take operands. It is up to the code generator how to
encode these operands. The operands given include
    * addresses (branch instructions)
    * actual parameter count (for call instructions)
    * SEE_value (for the literal instruction)

The value stack
---------------

The value stack is used for computing expressions. Most of the instructions
described in this file work on the value stack.

See the section on 'Notation' below for more information.

The block stack
---------------

Some of the instructions in this file work on the block stack. The block 
stack is used for keeping track of:

    * enumerators ('for ... in')
    * try-catch and try-finally handling
    * scope extension ('with')

Blocks are created using S.ENUM, S.TRYC, S.TRYF, S.WITH instructions, and
are numbered from one. Some block types cannot be directly created by an
instruction. All blocks end with the END instruction, which can end
multiple blocks. Ending block zero (END,0) terminates the function.

The process of ending a block will have side effects depending on the block
being ended. For example, ending the FINALLY block transfers control to a
finally handler, and pushes a FINALLY2 block onto the block stack (whose 
purpose is to restore C and PC correctly when it is ended).

Initial conditions
------------------

    PC <- initial instruction
    C <- undefined
    T <- "":0
    E <- ? (not defined)
    block stack <- empty
    value stack <- empty

INSTRUCTION SUMMARY
===================

Notation
--------

Instructions marked with a '*' below may throw exceptions. Instructions 
without an '*' do not throw exceptions.

Instructions that operate on the value stack describe the before and after
states of the stack in the form "before | after". For example, the
subtraction operator SUB is indicated like this:

	SUB    num1 num2 | num3

Indicating that num2 is first popped off the stack, followed by num1,
then num3 is pushed. The top of the stack is always rightmost in the list.
An empty list is represented by "-"

The elements on the value stack are of constrained types. The abbreviations used
are:

    * bool	- SEE_BOOLEAN
    * num	- SEE_NUMBER
    * str	- SEE_STRING
    * obj	- SEE_OBJECT
    * ref	- SEE_REFERENCE (possibly)
    * cmpl	- SEE_COMPLETION
    * null	- SEE_NULL
    * undef	- SEE_UNDEFINED

    * any	- any SEE_value (i.e. unknown type)
    * val	- sam as any, excluding cmpl or ref
    * prim	- same as val, excluding obj


Three further abbreviations are used to refer to special implementation
values, that need not be represented on the physical stack but could be:

    * enum	- a value encapsulating a struct SEE_enum *
    * ctxt	- a value encapsulating a SEE_context_t
    * with	- a value encapsulating restoration of a scope context

Generally, expressions make use of the value stack, while statements 
make use of the block stack and the C register.


Call instructions

	1. If Type(objC) is not object, throw a TypeError exception
	2. If objC does not implement [[Construct]] throw a TypeError exception
	3. Call the [[Construct]] method on objC, providing any0..anyn as
	   the argument values (may be empty, i.e. n = 0) setting 

*   CALL,n 	anyC any1..anyn | valR 

	1. Call GetValue(anyC) -> objC
	2. If Type(objC) is not Object, throw a TypeError exception

Branch instructions

    B.ALWAYS,x 	    - | -
	Sets PC <- x

    B.TRUE,x	 bool | -
	If bool is true, then set PC <- x

    B.ENUM,x	    - | - str		(when branch IS taken)
		    - | -		(when branch IS NOT taken)
	If the enumeration register E is exhausted, branches to <x>.
	Otherwise, pushes the next identifier string from E onto the value
	stack and does not branch.
	The B.ENUM instruction only returns strings str where 
	obj.[[HasProperty]](str) is true. (This is checked each time).

Block instructions

    S.ENUM	    obj | -
	Pushes an enumeration block. See B.ENUM instruction and
	the section below on 'The ENUM block'.
	
	Conceptually, this instruction saves register E, and then
	then sets E to the enumeration of obj.

    S.WITH	    obj | -
	Inserts obj into the front of the context's scope chain,
	and pushes a 'WITH' block. See 'The WITH block', below.

    S.TRYC,x	    str | -
	Creates and pushes a CATCH block. See 'The CATCH block' below.
	The address x indicates the entry point of the catch handler.

    S.TRYF,x	    - | -
	Creates and pushes a CATCH block. See 'The CATCH block' below.
	The address x indicates the entry point of the finally handler.
	The finally handler should end with an END

    END,n	    - | ?
	Pops all blocks up to and including the nth block, invoking their
	end behaviours in sequence. The virtual machine is terminated
	on an END,0 instruction.

	Conceptually, the END instruction performs one pop, and then
	returns control to itself (i.e. the PC does not advance) until the
	block stack height is smaller than n.


Block behaviour
---------------

The WITH block

    A WITH block is created with the S.WITH instruction. 

    When this block is created, it records the state of the scope chain
    before the insertion by S.WITH.

    When this block is ended, it restores the scope chain.
    There is no other side-effect.

The ENUM block

    An ENUM block is created with the S.ENUM instruction. 
    It affects only the way the B.ENUM instruction works.

    When this block is ended, it restores any previous enumeration before
    the S.ENUM instruction. There is no other side-effect.

The CATCH block

    A CATCH block is created with the S.TRYC instruction. It initialises
    a SEE_TRY context.

    When a CATCH block is ended, it is removed from the block stack, and
    the SEE_TRY context is finalized. There is no other side-effect.

    If an exception occurs within the context, the following steps happen:
	- the SEE_TRY context is finalized.
	- the value stack is truncated to its length at the time of S.TRYC
	- a new Object is created, with a property set to the caught exception
	  value. This object is inserted at the front of the scope chain.
	- the CATCH block is replaced by a WITH block
	- control is passed to the address given to the S.TRYC instruction

    Note that the catch handler should end with an END,n instruction and
    fall through to control after the try-catch block.

The FINALLY block

    A FINALLY block is created with the S.TRYF instruction. It initialises
    a SEE_TRY context.

    When a FINALLY block is ended, the following steps happen:
	- the SEE_TRY context is finalised.
	- the value stack is truncated to its length at the time of S.TRYF
	- the FINALLY block is replaced with a FINALLY2 block
	- the PC of the END instruction is stored in the FINALLY2 block
	- control is passed to the finally handler.

    When an exception occurs inside a FINALLY block context, the
    same steps occur, except that instead of a PC, a flag is recorded in 
    the FINALLY2 block to indicate that an exception was caught and it
    should be re-thrown.

    Note that the finally handler should end with an END,n instruction
    that will send flow of control elsewhere.

The FINALLY2 block

    A FINALLY2 block is created only when a FINALLY block is ended.
    When the FINALLY2 block is ended, the following steps happen:
	- if an exception was recorded as caught, then it is rethrown
	  as if SEE_DEFAULT_CATCH() were called
	- otherwise, flow of control is returned to the PC stored previously.
	  (this will cause the triggering END instruction to be re-executed).
