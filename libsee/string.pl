# Usage:   string.pl [h|c] string.defs
#
# Readss a file of string definitions and outputs C code that compiles
# to static UTF-16 strings. Each string definitions must fit one of these
# forms:
#
#	<ident>
#	<ident> = "text"
#
# Blank lines and lines starting with a hash ('#') are ignored.
#
# There are two modes: 'h' and 'c', corresponding to generation of
# the C header file, or the C compilation unit.
