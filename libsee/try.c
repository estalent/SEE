/*
 * Exception handling
 *
 * This implementation of exceptions uses the C stack and
 * C's setjmp/longjmp to implement exceptions. The TRY macro
 * is a sets up and tests a setjmp, and the THROW macros 
 * just do a longjmp. (That is why a garbage collector is
 * needed!)
 *
 * NOTE: I had considered using a special-return mechanism
 * for exceptions, but the complexity, performance and annoyance 
 * of the vast number of 'return checking' required and the
 * small number of expected actual exceptions during normal
 * operation made this mechanism far more favourable. Also,
 * setjmp/longjmp is part of standard POSIX and ANSI C, so
 * portability is not really lost.
