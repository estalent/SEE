Flag	Description
-------	-----------

** ECMA-262-3 Appendix B **

262_3B	Date.toGMTString() is defined, and made equivalent to toUTCString()
262_3B	Date.getYear() and Date.setYear() are defined.
262_3B	Global object has escape() and unescape() functions defined.
262_3B	String.substr() is defined

** Miscellaneous extensions **

EXT1	lexical analyser will recognise octal integers (ie integers starting
	with '0') and will throw an error if they contain a non-octal digit.

EXT1	Coercing native values that do not have a [[DefaultValue]] internal
	property will return an object-unique string, instead of throwing
	a type error.

EXT1	the string representation of a bad date will return the string
	"Invalid Date", instead of "NaN"

EXT1	new Date(s) will recognise date strings of the form '1/1/1999 12:30 AM'

EXT1	Function.prototype will not have a 'prototype' property of its own.

EXT1	Function.prototype.toString() applied to built-in functions and
	constructors (which are not function instances) will return a bogus
	do-nothing FunctionDeclaration instead of throwing a type error.

EXT1	The global object has its [[Prototype]] set to Object.prototype,
	effectively making all its properties available to the global scope,
	but having the good side effect of allowing 'toString()' to
	work anywhere.

EXT1	Global's URI and URL escaping and encoding routines generate uppercase 
	hexadecimal characters instead of lowercase.

EXT1	Calling eval() with a 'this' different to the global object runs
	its contents with the scope and variable object set to 'this'
	(instead of inheriting the caller's context).

EXT1	Native objects synthesize a property "__proto__" with the same
	value as the internal [[Prototype]] property (or null). Assignments
	to __proto__ are accepted if they don't cause a cycle.

EXT1	Native functions assign themselves the "arguments" property when
	called, so that the old idiom of using f.arguments will work.

EXT1	The arguments objects have a default value which is a string
	representing the arguments.

EXT1	In regular expressions character classes, treat as literals the chars
	']' placed first, and '-' when placed last.
	ie: /[^]Aa-zB-]/ == /[^\]Aa-zB\-]/.

EXT1	Array.join(undefined) uses "undefined" as a join string instead of ",".
