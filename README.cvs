DEVELOPER NOTES

1. After checking this out from CVS, you will first need to initialise
the build environment with the following commands:

	$ aclocal && \
	  autoheader && \
	  libtoolize --copy && \
	  autoconf && \
	  automake -v -a --foreign --copy

You'll also find that you need libtool installed, and probably the
boehm-gc package.

[If there are problems with old versions of libtool not finding
configure.ac, make a symbolic from configure.in to configure.ac.
This may cause automake to whine slightly, but it will be okay.
Perhaps, one day, libtool will be fixed and find configure.ac.]

2. Next, you will need to go into the 'unicode' directory and do
a make there. This will probably download unicode tables, and compress
them, generating a libsee/unicode.c file (intended to be distributed).

3. At this stage, you should be able to run configure, like everyone else.
Enable the cache with -C because when developing, it helps hasten builds.
Finally build with GNU make.

	$ sh configure -C
	$ gmake

4. If you plan on modifying libsee to work on your architecture,
please work with configure.ac primarily.
