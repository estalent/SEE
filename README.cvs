DEVELOPER NOTES

After checking out this from CVS, you will need to build
the configure and makefiles from the top level with:

	$ autoconf
	$ automake -v -a --foreign

If there are problems with old versions of libtool not finding
configure.ac, make a symbolic from configure.in to configure.ac.
(This may cause automake to whine slightly, but it is okay.)
