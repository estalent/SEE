DEVELOPER NOTES

1. After checking this out from CVS, you will first need to initialise
the build environment with the following commands:

	$ autoreconf --install
	$ sh configure CFLAGS="-Wall -ggdb -O2"

You'll also find that you need libtool installed, and probably the
boehm-gc package.

[If there are problems with old versions of libtool not finding
configure.ac, make a symbolic from configure.in to configure.ac.
This may cause automake to whine slightly, but it will be okay.
Perhaps, one day, libtool will be fixed and find configure.ac.]

2. Next, you will need to go into the 'unicode' directory and do
a make there. This will probably download unicode tables, and compress
them, generating a libsee/unicode.c file (intended to be distributed).

3. At this stage, you should be able to run configure, like everyone else.
Enable the cache with -C because when developing, it helps hasten builds.
Finally build with GNU make.

	$ sh configure -C
	$ gmake

4. If you plan on modifying libsee to work on your architecture,
please work with configure.ac primarily.


RELEASE STEPS

1. Update Changelog by running 'cvs2cl'
2. Make sure that the package is configured (autoreconf --install)
3. Create a temporary build dir (e.g. /tmp/b), cd there and run
   the configure script from the check-out directory.
4. make distcheck
