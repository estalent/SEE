Developers may be interested in testing SEE against the extremely
comprehensive Mozilla test suite.

Doing a 'make check' in this directory will check out the current
Mozilla test suite, configure the run-mozilla-tests script to
use the see-shell binary, and then run all tests.

Why some of the mozilla tests fail
----------------------------------

This section contains notes on why some tests failing are acceptable.

  ecma/Date/15.9.5.10-1.js
  ecma/Date/15.9.5.10-9.js 
  ecma/Date/15.9.5.12-1.js
  ecma/Date/...
  	- SEE doesn't seme to compute daylight savings the same way as
	  SM. This is permitted because SEE is consistent, and the standard
	  doesn't say how to compute daylight savings or local timezone.
	  These errors all seem to have local timezone calculation as the
	  underlying cause.

Bug numbers
-----------

 Many of the mozilla tests have a BUGNUMBER reference. Check out their
 status in their bugzilla. For example,

	 BUGNUMBER: 320483
	 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=320483
