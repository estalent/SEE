Developers may be interested in testing SEE against the extremely
comprehensive Mozilla test suite.

Doing a 'make check' in this directory will check out the current
Mozilla test suite, configure the run-mozilla-tests script to
use the see-shell binary, and then run all tests.

You will need a perl module called Getopt::Mixed (can be found at cpan.org)

Why some of the mozilla tests fail
----------------------------------

This section contains notes on why some tests failing are acceptable.

  js1_2/Objects/toString-001.js
  	- Object.toString() in JS1.2 converted objects to literal displays,
	  but it is dangerous to do this (recursion), so SEE deliberately
	  doesn't do this.

  ecma/Date/15.9.5.10-12.js
  	- The netscape test code appears to have incorrect
	  PST daylight savings times.


Bug numbers
-----------

 Many of the mozilla tests have a BUGNUMBER reference. Check out their
 status in their bugzilla. For example,

	 BUGNUMBER: 320483
	 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=320483
