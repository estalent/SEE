Developers may be interested in testing SEE against the extremely
comprehensive Mozilla test suite.

1. Check out the Mozilla test suite 

 Use the following commands to obtain the test files

 $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot login
 Password: <empty password: just hit enter>
 $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot co mozilla/js/tests

2. Configure the RUN.mozilla script

 Copy the RUN.mozilla script from this directory into mozilla/js/tests/RUN, 
 then edit it to point to a see-shell executable that you have compiled.
 Often this is a reference directly into your SEE build directory, namely
 shell/see-shell.static.

3. Run the RUN script

 Execute the RUN shell script from within mozilla/js/tests/.
 It writes all its output to $0.out (ie usually RUN.out)
 It writes progress information to stderr, and errors found to stdout.

4. Why some of the mozilla tests fail

* ecma/Date/15.9.5.10-1.js
  ecma/Date/15.9.5.10-9.js 
  ecma/Date/15.9.5.12-1.js
  ecma/Date/...
  	- SEE doesn't seme to compute daylight savings the same way as
	  SM. This is permitted because SEE is consistent, and the standard
	  doesn't say how to compute daylight savings or local timezone.
	  These errors all seem to have local timezone calculation as the
	  underlying cause.
