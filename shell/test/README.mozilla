Developers may be interested in testing SEE against the extremely
comprehensive Mozilla test suite.

1. Check out the Mozilla test suite 

 Use the following commands to obtain the test files

 $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot login
 Password: <empty password: just hit enter>
 $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot co mozilla/js/tests

2. Configure the RUN.mozilla script

 Copy the RUN.mozilla script from this directory into mozilla/js/tests/RUN, 
 then edit it to point to a see-shell executable that you have compiled.
 Often this is a reference directly into your SEE build directory, namely
 shell/see-shell.static.

3. Run the RUN script

 Execute the RUN shell script from within mozilla/js/tests/.
 It writes all its output to $0.out (ie usually RUN.out)
 It writes progress information to stderr, and errors found to stdout.

Note: Not all test failures necessarily mean an error in SEE.
