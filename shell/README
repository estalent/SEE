SEE SHELL

This is an ECMAScript shell program used to test and demonstrate 
the SEE run-time library. It reads ECMAScript input and executes
it. It also has a simplistic 'HTML' mode where it will pre-process
a HTML document a little bit like a browser would.

Usage:
	shell [-d<debugflags>] [-f file] [-h html] 

The '-f file' and '-h html' options can be specified multiple times.
Each time they are specified, the given file is loaded and run.
The first exception terminate the process, otherwise it exits with 0.

Files specified with -f are loaded and run as pure ECMAScript. The
entire file is parsed as a 'Program' in the grammar, and the
global statements are evaluated.

Files specified with -h are loaded as HTML. The
file is copied to stdout, but all text found inside <SCRIPT> elements
are interpreted as ECMAScript (regardless of the LANGUAGE attribute).
Exceptions are ignored in this mode.

if no -f or -h flags are given (or a "-f -" argument is given), an
interactive prompt is supplied, and individual statements are read
from standard input.

NB The funny command line interface was designed to be compatible with
the perl script used with Mozilla/spidermonkey's test suite.
