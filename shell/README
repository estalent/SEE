SEE SHELL

This is an ECMAScript shell program used to test and demonstrate 
the SEE run-time library. It reads ECMAScript input and executes
it. It also has a simplistic 'HTML' mode where it will pre-process
a HTML document a little bit like a browser would.

Usage:
	shell [-d<debugflags>] [-f file] [-h htmlfile] 

The '-f file' and '-h htmlfile' options can be specified multiple times.
Each time they are specified, the given file is loaded and run.

Files specified with -f are loaded and run as pure ECMAScript. The
entire file is parsed as a 'Program' in the grammar, and the
global statements are evaluated.  An exception in a parsed file terminate
the process, otherwise it exits with 0.

Files specified with -h are loaded as HTML. The file is copied to
stdout, but all text found inside <SCRIPT> elements are stripped and run
as ECMAScript (regardless of its LANGUAGE attribute).  Exceptions
are ignored in HTML files.

if no -f or -h flags are given (or a "-f -" argument is given), an
interactive prompt is produced, and individual statements are read
from standard input until EOF.

NB. The command line arguments are chosen to be compatible with
the perl script used with Mozilla/spidermonkey's test suite.
