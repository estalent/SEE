SEE SHELL

This is an ECMAScript shell program used to test and demonstrate 
the SEE run-time library. It reads ECMAScript input and executes
it. It also has a simplistic 'HTML' mode where it will pre-process
a HTML document a little bit like a browser would.

Usage:
	shell [-d<debugflags>] [-f file] [-h htmlfile] 

The '-f file' and '-h htmlfile' options can be specified multiple times.
Each time they are specified, the given file is loaded and run.

Files specified with -f are loaded and run as pure ECMAScript. The
entire file is parsed as a 'Program' (see the language grammar), and the
global statements are evaluated.  An exception in the file terminate
the process (exit 1), otherwise it continues.

Files specified with -h are loaded as HTML. The HTMl content is copied to
stdout, except all text found inside <SCRIPT> elements are stripped and run
as ECMAScript (regardless of the LANGUAGE attribute).  Exceptions
are ignored in HTML files. (Lazy browser behaviour!)

If no -f or -h flags are given (or a "-f -" argument is given), an
interactive prompt is produced, and individual statements are read
from standard input until EOF.

NOTE: The command line arguments were chosen to be compatible with
the perl script used with Mozilla/spidermonkey's test suite.
