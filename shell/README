SEE SHELL

This is an ECMAScript shell program used to test and demonstrate 
the SEE run-time library. It reads ECMAScript files and executes
them. It includes a simplistic 'HTML' mode where it will pre-process
a HTML document a little bit like a browser would. It also provides
an interactive (prompted) mode.


Usage
-----
	shell [-d<debugflags>] [-f file] [-h htmlfile] 

The '-f file' and '-h htmlfile' options can be specified multiple times.
Each time they are specified, the given files are loaded and run.

Files specified with -f are loaded and run as pure ECMAScript. The
entire file is parsed as a 'Program' (see the language grammar), and the
global statements are evaluated.  If an exception during execution of
the file, it terminates the process (exit 1), otherwise processing continues.

Files specified with -h are loaded as HTML. The HTMl content is copied to
stdout, except for text found inside <SCRIPT> elements. It is stripped and run
as ECMAScript (regardless of the LANGUAGE attribute).  Exceptions
are ignored in HTML files. (Lazy browser behaviour!) There is no support for
forms or triggers such as 'onLoad'. 

If no -f or -h flags are given (or a "-f -" argument is given), an
interactive prompt is produced, and individual statements are read
from standard input until EOF.

NOTE: The command line arguments were chosen to be compatible with
the perl script used with Mozilla/spidermonkey's test suite.


Shell-provided objects and functions
------------------------------------

Besides the standard environment required by ECMA-262,
the shell provides a couple of objects useful for testing.

 print       - a function object which takes one
               string argument and prints it, followed
               by a newline.
 version     - an undefined value, used to satisfy some tests.

In HTML mode the following objects are provided:

 document            - a simple Object with some properties:
 document.write      - a function to print a string to stdout
 document.navigator  - a simple Object used as a placeholder
 document.userAgent  - "SEE-shell (see-1.0)" or similar
 document.window     - a reference to the Global object
